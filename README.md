# foodeze
An app to make running a loal food-buying group easy.

Eating well and living mindfully leads away from supermarkets with their long supply chains, squeezing of farmers and chasing of shareholder profits toward small groups of people cooperating to buy from trusted farmers in their area. To source organic food locally and reliably is quite complex especially on the scale of 10 - 30 members of a typical food group. Foodeze is intended to take away much of the pain of organising custom boxes to members on a regular basis.
